This is a Readme.txt file for this Classes Repository. The oop_bank folder has a ruby doc named bank_account.rb that has a BankAccount class that allows the user to set their balance, then make deposits, transfer balances between other accounts, and set their own minimum balance. Inside of the spec folder, you have a spec file that your can run with rspec that allows you to test the bank_account.rb file. In the spirit of TDD 👍🏽!
